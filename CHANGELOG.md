## 🚀 Recent Updates & Changelog

### 🏗️ Architecture & Integration
* **Frontend/Backend Separation:** Fully separated the logic engine from the UI.
* **Module Integration:** Successfully linked the frontend to the backend using relative imports.
* **Callback Communication:** Upgraded the backend `connect()` method to accept an `onSensorUpdate` callback, allowing it to stream live radar data directly to the frontend.

### 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements
* **Dynamic Battery Indicator:** Replaced the static text battery with a dynamic CSS visual icon that scales width and changes colors (Green/Yellow/Red) based on backend data.
* **Custom Toggle Switches:** Upgraded standard HTML checkboxes into modern, smooth-sliding pill switches.
* **Manual Disconnect Feedback:** Added voice confirmation (`"Band disconnected"`) and a light haptic double-tap when the user manually disconnects the system.

### ⚙️ Core Logic & State Fixes
* **Resolved "Stale Closure" State Bugs:** Implemented React `useRef` hooks to act as live memory pointers. Changes to Voice Guidance and Haptic Intensity now take effect *instantly*.
* **Radar Pacing Optimization:** Slowed down the backend sensor simulation delay from `600ms` to `2500ms` to create a realistic pacing for voice alerts.

### ✨ Advanced Features (Presentation Ready)
* **Two-Finger Gesture Control:** Implemented a full-screen, touch-sensitive wrapper. Users can now double-tap anywhere on the screen with two fingers to instantly toggle "Crowd Mode" without visual UI.
* **Emergency Watchdog Demonstration:** Adjusted the backend simulated heartbeat to intentionally "die" after 15 seconds to demonstrate the emergency disconnect protocol.
* **Network Expose:** Updated `package.json` dev scripts to include the `--host` flag, allowing the local dev server to be accessed via a mobile hotspot for live hardware simulation.
